## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-07

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

**The standalone `Gmail_GTD.ahk` and `Outlook_GTD.ahk` scripts have been removed.**

You must now use the unified `GTD_Automation.ahk` script for both platforms.

**What you need to do:**
1. Delete old shortcuts to `Gmail_GTD.ahk` and `Outlook_GTD.ahk`
2. Create a new shortcut to `GTD_Automation.ahk`
3. Use the same hotkeys—they work identically in both Gmail and Outlook

### Added

- **Unified script** - Run `GTD_Automation.ahk` for both Gmail and Outlook. The script automatically detects which email client is active and applies the correct automation.

- **Automatic platform detection** - The script switches between Gmail and Outlook modes based on your active window. No manual configuration needed.

- **Modular architecture** - Code reorganized into separate library modules (`lib/GmailGTD.ahk` and `lib/OutlookGTD.ahk`) for easier maintenance and future extensibility.

### What Stayed the Same

- All hotkeys (Alt+A, Alt+W, Alt+R, etc.) work exactly as before
- All features and functionality remain unchanged
- Configuration files (`config.ini` for Outlook) work the same way
